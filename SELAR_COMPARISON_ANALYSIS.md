  paystack.newTransaction({
    key: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY!,
    email,
    amount: amount * 100, // Convert to kobo
    currency: 'NGN',
    ref: orderId,
    onSuccess: (transaction) => {
      // Verify payment on backend

These three features represent **80% of Selar's core value proposition**. Without them, you cannot process real transactions.

**Estimated Time to MVP:** 4-6 weeks (working full-time)
