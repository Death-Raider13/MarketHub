  paystack.newTransaction({

    email,
    amount: amount * 100, // Convert to kobo
    currency: 'NGN',

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

**Your platform has a solid foundation** with excellent admin features and a unique advertising system. However, to compete with Selar, you **MUST** implement:

1. üî¥ **Payment integration** (Paystack/Stripe)
2. üî¥ **Digital product support** (file upload, delivery, access)
3. üî¥ **Email automation** (order confirmations, delivery)

These three features represent **80% of Selar's core value proposition**. Without them, you cannot process real transactions.

**Your advertising system is a unique advantage** that Selar doesn't have. Once you implement the core features above, you'll have a **superior platform** that combines Selar's functionality with additional revenue streams from advertising.

**Estimated Time to MVP:** 4-6 weeks (working full-time)
**Estimated Time to Full Feature Parity:** 12-16 weeks

---

**Good luck! You're closer than you think. Focus on the payment integration first, and everything else will follow.** üöÄ
