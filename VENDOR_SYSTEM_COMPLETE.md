## 🔐 **Firestore Security Rules:**

### **Products Collection:**
```javascript
match /products/{productId} {
  // Anyone can read active products
  allow read: if resource.data.status == 'active';
  
  // Vendors can read their own products
  allow read: if isSignedIn() && resource.data.vendorId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // All writes via Admin SDK (API routes)
  allow create, update, delete: if false;
  
  // Admins can do everything
  allow read, write: if isAdmin();
}
```

### **Store Customization Collection:**
```javascript
match /storeCustomization/{vendorId} {
  // Vendors can read/write their own settings
  allow read, write: if isSignedIn() && request.auth.uid == vendorId;
  
  // Anyone can read (for public store pages)
  allow read: if true;
  
  // Admins can read all
  allow read: if isAdmin();
}
```
