# 🚨 CRITICAL: DEPLOY FIRESTORE RULES NOW

## ⚠️ **Error: Permission Denied**

```
Error: 7 PERMISSION_DENIED: Missing or insufficient permissions.
```

**This error means Firestore security rules are blocking the updates!**

---

## ✅ **SOLUTION - Run This Command:**

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**This is REQUIRED for the system to work!**

---

## 🔒 **What the Rules Do:**

The updated rules allow:
- ✅ Users to update their own `accountBalance` (add funds)
- ✅ Users to create campaigns in `adCampaigns` collection
- ✅ Users to create transactions in `transactions` collection
- ✅ Only balance increases (can't decrease)

Without deploying these rules, **NOTHING will work!**

---

## 📋 **Steps:**

### **1. Deploy Rules:**
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

### **2. Wait for Deployment:**
```
✔ Deploy complete!
```

### **3. Restart Dev Server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **4. Test Payment:**
1. Click "Add Funds"
2. Enter ₦5,000
3. Complete payment
4. ✅ Should work now!

---

## 🎯 **Why This is Critical:**

**Before deploying rules:**
- ❌ Permission denied errors
- ❌ Balance won't update
- ❌ Campaigns won't save
- ❌ Transactions won't record

**After deploying rules:**
- ✅ Balance updates work
- ✅ Campaigns save successfully
- ✅ Transactions recorded
- ✅ Everything works!

---

## 🚀 **DO THIS NOW:**

```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

**Without this, the system CANNOT work!**
