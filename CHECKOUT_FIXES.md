## 🔴 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Currency Conversion Issue (USD to NGN)
**Problem:**
- Cart prices were in USD
- Paystack payment gateway requires NGN (Nigerian Naira)
- No conversion was happening, causing incorrect payment amounts

**Solution:**
- Added `USD_TO_NGN_RATE` constant (set to 1650, update as needed)
- Calculate `totalInNGN` by multiplying USD total by conversion rate
- Pass NGN amount to Paystack: `amount: totalInNGN`
- Store both USD and NGN amounts in order metadata

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
const USD_TO_NGN_RATE = 1650 // Update this rate as needed
const totalInNGN = total * USD_TO_NGN_RATE

// In payment initiation
amount: totalInNGN, // Convert USD to NGN
metadata: {
  amount_usd: total,
  conversion_rate: USD_TO_NGN_RATE
}
```

### 2. Removed Non-Functional Card Input Fields
**Problem:**
- Checkout page had card number, CVV, and expiry date input fields
- These fields were non-functional since Paystack handles all payment details
- Caused user confusion and poor UX

**Solution:**
- Removed all card input fields (lines 343-363)
- Replaced with clear information about Paystack payment
- Added amount display showing both NGN and USD
- Improved payment method description

**New UI:**
```typescript
<div className="rounded-lg bg-muted p-4 space-y-2">
  <p className="text-sm font-medium">💳 Payment Information</p>
  <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
    You will be redirected to Paystack's secure payment page to complete your transaction.
  </p>
  <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
    Amount to pay: <span className="font-bold">₦{totalInNGN.toLocaleString()}</span> (${total.toFixed(2)} USD)
  </p>
</div>
```

---

### 3. Digital Products Support
**Problem:**
- Checkout didn't differentiate between physical and digital products
- Shipping was always required, even for digital-only orders
- No indication to users about product type

**Solution:**
- Added `requiresShipping` check based on product type
- Conditional shipping cost calculation
- Show "Digital Product - No Shipping" message
- Skip shipping method selection for digital products
- Change step 1 label from "Shipping" to "Details" for digital products

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Check if cart has physical products that require shipping
const requiresShipping = items.some(item => item.product.requiresShipping)

// Conditional shipping cost
const shippingCost = requiresShipping 
  ? (shippingMethod === "express" ? 19.99 : totalPrice > 50 ? 0 : 9.99)
  : 0

// UI indicator for digital products
{!requiresShipping && (
  <div className="rounded-lg bg-blue-50 p-4">
    <p>📦 Your order contains digital products only. No shipping required!</p>
  </div>
)}
```

## ⚠️ Medium Priority Issues Fixed

### 4. Country Field Default Value
**Problem:**
- Default country was "United States"
- App uses Paystack (Nigerian payment gateway)
- Inconsistent with target market

**Solution:**
- Changed default country to "Nigeria"

**Code Change:**
```typescript
country: "Nigeria", // Changed from "United States"
```

---

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling
**Problem:**
- No validation before payment submission
- No feedback for empty cart
- Missing user authentication checks
- No shipping address validation

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive validation in `handlePaymentSubmit`
- Added shipping address validation in `handleShippingSubmit`
- User-friendly error messages with toast notifications

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
const handlePaymentSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  
  // Validate cart is not empty
  if (items.length === 0) {
    toast.error('Your cart is empty')
    router.push('/cart')
    return
  }
  
  // Validate user is logged in
  if (!user) {
    toast.error('Please log in to complete your purchase')
    router.push('/auth/login')
    return
  }
  
  setLoading(true)
  // ... rest of payment logic
}

const handleShippingSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  
  // Skip shipping validation for digital-only orders
  if (!requiresShipping) {
    setStep(2)
    return
  }
  
  // Validate shipping address for physical products
  if (!shippingAddress.fullName || !shippingAddress.addressLine1 || 
      !shippingAddress.city || !shippingAddress.state || !shippingAddress.phone) {
    toast.error('Please fill in all required shipping fields')
    return
  }
  
  setStep(2)
}
```

### 6. Order Number Display
**Problem:**
- Used random string for order number display
- Didn't match actual Firestore order ID

**Solution:**
- Store completed order ID in state
- Display first 8 characters of actual order ID

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
const [completedOrderId, setCompletedOrderId] = useState<string | null>(null)

// After successful payment
setCompletedOrderId(orderId)

// Display in success page
<p className="text-lg font-bold">
  #{completedOrderId?.substring(0, 8).toUpperCase() || 'PROCESSING'}
</p>
```

---

### 7. Improved Order Summary
**Problem:**
- No distinction between USD and NGN amounts
- Shipping always shown even for digital products

**Solution:**
- Show both USD and NGN totals
- Conditional shipping display
- Clear labeling for digital products

**Code Changes:**
```typescript
<div className="border-t border-border pt-4 space-y-1">
  <div className="flex justify-between text-lg font-bold">
    <span>Total (USD)</span>
    <span>${total.toFixed(2)}</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex justify-between text-sm text-muted-foreground">
    <span>Total (NGN)</span>
    <span>₦{totalInNGN.toLocaleString('en-NG', { 
      minimumFractionDigits: 2, 
      maximumFractionDigits: 2 
    })}</span>
  </div>
</div>

{!requiresShipping && (
  <div className="flex justify-between text-sm">
    <span className="text-muted-foreground">Shipping</span>
    <span className="font-medium text-green-600">Digital Product - No Shipping</span>
  </div>
)}
```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### Update Currency Conversion Rate
The conversion rate is currently hardcoded. You should:

1. **Update the rate regularly** in `app/checkout/page.tsx`:
```typescript
const USD_TO_NGN_RATE = 1650 // Update this rate as needed
```

2. **Consider using a currency API** for real-time rates:
   - [Exchange Rate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/)
   - [Fixer.io](https://fixer.io/)
   - [Open Exchange Rates](https://openexchangerates.org/)

Example implementation:
```typescript
const [exchangeRate, setExchangeRate] = useState(1650)

useEffect(() => {
  fetch('https://api.exchangerate-api.com/v4/latest/USD')
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => setExchangeRate(data.rates.NGN))
    .catch(() => setExchangeRate(1650)) // Fallback rate
}, [])
```
