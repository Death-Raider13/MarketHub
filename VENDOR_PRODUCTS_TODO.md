# 🛠️ Vendor Products System - Implementation Plan

## 📊 **Current Status:**
- ❌ Products use mock data
- ❌ Create product doesn't save
- ❌ Edit product doesn't work
- ❌ No Firestore integration

---

## ✅ **What Needs to Be Done:**

### **1. Create API Routes:**
```
/api/vendor/products/route.ts
  - POST: Create product
  - GET: List products for vendor

/api/vendor/products/[id]/route.ts
  - GET: Get single product
  - PUT: Update product
  - DELETE: Delete product
```

### **2. Update Product Creation Page:**
- Load form data from Firestore if editing
- Upload images to Cloudinary
- Save product to Firestore
- Handle digital file uploads
- Validate all fields

### **3. Update Products List Page:**
- Fetch products from Firestore
- Show real product data
- Enable edit/delete actions
- Update stock in real-time

### **4. Firestore Structure:**
```javascript
products/{productId}
  ├── vendorId
  ├── name
  ├── description
  ├── price
  ├── compareAtPrice
  ├── category
  ├── subcategory
  ├── images[] (Cloudinary URLs)
  ├── stock
  ├── sku
  ├── type (physical/digital/service)
  ├── digitalFiles[] (for digital products)
  ├── variants[]
  ├── tags[]
  ├── status (active/draft/archived)
  ├── createdAt
  └── updatedAt
```

### **5. Firestore Rules:**
```javascript
match /products/{productId} {
  // Vendors can create their own products
  allow create: if isVerifiedVendor() &&
                  request.resource.data.vendorId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Vendors can read/update/delete their own products
  allow read, update, delete: if isVerifiedVendor() &&
                                  resource.data.vendorId == request.auth.uid;
  
  // Anyone can read active products
  allow read: if resource.data.status == 'active';
  
  // Admins can do everything
  allow read, write: if isAdmin();
}
```

## 🚀 **Implementation Priority:**

1. ✅ **DONE:** Store Customization persistence
2. 🔄 **NEXT:** Vendor Products CRUD
3. ⏳ **LATER:** Dashboard real data
4. ⏳ **LATER:** Orders integration
