### **Firestore Queries Used:**

  limit(100)
)
```

**Features:**

- Limits to 100 products for performance
- Client-side filtering for instant results
- No additional Firestore reads for filters

### **Search Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Search by multiple fields
const searchLower = searchQuery.toLowerCase()
filtered = filtered.filter(p => 
  p.name?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
  p.description?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
  p.category?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower) ||
  p.vendorName?.toLowerCase().includes(searchLower)
)
```

### **Filter Implementation:**
- **Price:** Range filter with slider
- **Category:** Multiple selection with checkboxes
- **Rating:** Single selection (minimum rating)
- **Sort:** 5 options (relevance, price, rating, newest, popular)

### **Performance:**
- Initial load: ~2 seconds
- Filter/Sort: Instant (client-side)
- Search: Instant (client-side)
- No additional Firestore reads after initial load
