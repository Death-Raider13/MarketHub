# 🎯 Advertiser Profile System - CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION

## ✅ **How It Works Now:**

### **Separate Advertiser Account**
- Users must create a **separate advertiser profile** to access the advertising system
- This is **independent** of their customer or creator account
- They can use the **same email** for convenience
- **No access to dashboard** without completing advertiser signup

## 🗄️ **Database Structure:**

### **Firestore Collections:**

```
users/
├── {userId}
    ├── email: "user@email.com"
    ├── role: "customer" | "creator"
    └── ... (regular user data)

advertisers/  ← NEW COLLECTION
├── {userId}  ← Same userId as users collection
    ├── uid: "userId"
    ├── email: "user@email.com"
    ├── businessName: "My Business"
    ├── businessEmail: "business@email.com"  ← Can be same or different
    ├── phone: "+234..."
    ├── website: "https://..."
    ├── businessType: "E-commerce"
    ├── accountStatus: "active"
    ├── accountBalance: 0
    ├── totalSpent: 0
    ├── campaigns: []
    ├── createdAt: timestamp
    └── updatedAt: timestamp
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ Separate `advertisers` collection
- ✅ Uses same `userId` as key
- ✅ Can have same or different email
- ✅ Independent of user role (customer/creator)

---

## 🎨 **Advertiser Signup Page:**

### **Features:**
```
✅ Checks if user is logged in
✅ Shows current user email
✅ Allows same or different business email
✅ Collects business information
✅ Checks for existing advertiser profile
✅ Creates profile in Firestore
✅ Redirects to dashboard after creation
```

### **Form Fields:**
```
Required:
- Business Name
- Business Email (pre-filled with user email, can change)
- Phone Number
- Business Type

Optional:
- Website

Checkbox:
- Agree to Terms & Conditions
```

---

## 🛡️ **Dashboard Protection:**

### **Multi-Level Check:**
```typescript
// app/advertiser/dashboard/page.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading) {
    if (!user) {
      // Not logged in → redirect to login
      router.push("/auth/login?returnUrl=/advertiser/dashboard")
    } else {
      // Logged in → check advertiser profile
      checkAdvertiserProfile()
    }
  }
}, [user, loading, router])

async function checkAdvertiserProfile() {
  const advertiserRef = doc(db, "advertisers", user.uid)
  const advertiserSnap = await getDoc(advertiserRef)

  if (advertiserSnap.exists()) {
    // Has profile → show dashboard
    setHasAdvertiserProfile(true)
  } else {
    // No profile → redirect to signup
    router.push("/advertiser/signup")
  }
}
```

**Protection Levels:**
1. ✅ Check if user is logged in
2. ✅ Check if user has advertiser profile
3. ✅ Only show dashboard if both checks pass
