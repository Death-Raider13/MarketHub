# 💰 Advertising Revenue System

## 🎯 **How Platform Revenue is Calculated**

Your marketplace now has a comprehensive advertising revenue system that generates income from ad campaigns. Here's exactly how the platform makes money:

---

## 📊 **Revenue Structure**

### **1. Platform Commission Rates**
```typescript
Default Configuration:
- Platform Commission: 30% of total ad spend
- Vendor Commission: 20% (for hosting ads on their stores)
- Advertiser Pays: 100% (full ad spend)
```

### **2. Revenue by Placement Type**

| Placement | Platform Share | Vendor Share | Example Revenue |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Homepage** | 100% | 0% | ₦1,000 from ₦1,000 spend |
| **Vendor Store** | 60% | 40% | ₦600 platform, ₦400 vendor |
| **Category Pages** | 100% | 0% | ₦1,000 from ₦1,000 spend |
| **Sponsored Products** | 100% | 0% | ₦1,000 from ₦1,000 spend |

### **3. Revenue Models**

#### **CPM (Cost Per Mille) - Impressions**
- **Minimum**: ₦50 per 1,000 impressions
- **Revenue**: Platform earns percentage based on placement
- **Example**: 10,000 impressions × ₦100 CPM = ₦1,000 → Platform earns ₦600-800

#### **CPC (Cost Per Click)**
- **Minimum**: ₦5 per click
- **Revenue**: Platform earns percentage of click costs
- **Example**: 100 clicks × ₦20 CPC = ₦2,000 → Platform earns ₦1,200-1,600

#### **CPA (Cost Per Acquisition)**
- **Revenue**: Platform earns from conversion-based campaigns
- **Example**: 10 conversions × ₦500 CPA = ₦5,000 → Platform earns ₦3,250-4,000
